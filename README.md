# microsoft-avro

This repository contains the Avro core extracted from the HDInsight SDK and
ported to the .NET Standard API on the .NET Core 2.0 runtime. It was last
tested against the 2.0.0-preview2-005858 version of the .NET Core tools and
runtime.

Prerequisites
-------------

  * Windows OS including Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.
  * .NET Cli tools: [https://github.com/dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)


Instructions
------------

You will need to build at the command line using the .NET Core SDK tools (dotnet)
since building in Visual Studio 2017 is not yet supported. However, the solution
can be opened in Visual Studio 2017. .NET Core applications will run on both
Windows and Linux.

    dotnet clean MicrosoftAvro.sln
    dotnet restore MicrosoftAvro.sln
    dotnet build -c Relase/Debug MicrosoftAvro.sln

 * `clean` cleans any previously built binary
 * `restore` restores nuget dependencies
 * `build` builds the solution

To build nuget packages, type the following:

 * `dotnet pack MicrosoftAvro.sln`

Projects will build out to `Microsoft-Avro\bin\<AssemblyName>` and will contain
all the platforms that the project supports.
